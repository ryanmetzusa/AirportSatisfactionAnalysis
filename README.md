# AirportSatisfactionAnalysis

A project from my master program, finding customer satisfaction through multiple features. Creating models to assess problems. I've attached the dataset and variable definitions. 

In this project, I did initial EDA. Relabeled target variable levels. Made a probit regression model to find the characterisitcs of each level of the target variable. In the second part I had data from sales of a cereal company. I created a linear model and found any instruments have relevancy with f-test. Then I went to find the sensitivity of the instruments to reduce bias. The final model had the best predictive outcome. I compared each step with anova analysis of the model.
